criterion. max is an example of a benchmark function with a loop. (Max simply finds the maximum element in an array).Note that this is only used as an example. The algorithm has been tested on other benchmark fucntions
The uploaded file branch_coverage.pdf is a paper published in 2018 by the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Journal. This paper contains the description of MOSA
The file max_LPCF.java is an implemetation of the proposed loop path coverage work in this project. LPCF extend the generic
many objective formulation for test case generation, in (See branch_coverage.pdf) to design an adapative re-use framework capable of attaining
high coverage levels in programs under test loops
The file benchmark.pdf lists the benchmark fucntions from various repositories on which the experiments were conducted
